> The Libyan crisis is the current humanitarian crisis and political-military instability occurring in Libya, 
> beginning with the Arab Spring protests of 2011, which led to two civil wars, 
> foreign military intervention, and the ousting and killing of Muammar Gaddafi. 
> 
> The first civil war's aftermath and proliferation of armed groups 
> led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. 
> The second war lasted until October 23, 2020, when all parties agreed to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations.
>
> The crisis in Libya has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the onset of violence in 2011. 
> During both civil wars, the output of Libya's economically crucial oil industry 
> collapsed to a small fraction of its usual level, 
> despite having the largest oil reserves of any African country, 
> with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival groups.
>
> **Since March 2022, two different governments control the country**, 
> - the Tripoli-based and internationally recognized Government of National Unity, 
>   which controls the western part of the country and is led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, 
> - and the House of Representatives-recognized Government of National Stability, 
>   which nominally governs the central and eastern part of Libya 
>   and is led by Osama Hammad under the de facto rule of the Libyan National Army and its commander Khalifa Haftar.
